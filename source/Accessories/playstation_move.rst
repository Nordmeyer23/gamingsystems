The PlayStation Move is a handheld controller with a glowing orb on the top that works with the PlayStation Eye camera to track video game. PlayStation Eye camera works with the PlayStation Move to track video game movements like punches, sword strokes, and tennis racket swings. It also has regular controller buttons for shooting games that require you to pull a trigger. The PlayStation move was first released for the PlayStation 3 to compete with the Wii and Xbox 360 home consoles, respectively. Although it was introduced on the pre-existing PlayStation 3 console, Sony stated before it was released that it was treating Move's debut as its own major "platform launch".  It had an aggressive marketing campaign to support it. In 2013, Sony unveiled the PlayStation 4 and they also showed that the console will support PlayStation Move. It provides greater tracking precision via the PlayStation Camera and a depth-sensing stereo camera.

The PlayStation Move motion controller features an orb at the head that can glow in any of a full range of colors using RGB light-emitting diodes (LEDs). The system selects the color based on the colors in the user environment captured by the camera, and it can be distinguished from the rest of the scene. The colored light serves as an active marker, the position of which can be tracked along the image plane by the camera.
