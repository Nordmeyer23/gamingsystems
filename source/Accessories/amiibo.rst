Amiibo are a series of Nintendo character toys that interact with multiple games on the Wii U and 3DS. These figurines were first released in November 21, 2014 in the United States. Amiibo was announced in May 8, 2014, and they were unnamed when they were first revealed. They can store a character's unique data, such as a build in a particular game or be used as a key to unlock costumes or features. They can evolve as they are used in games and as new data is saved. They can unlock features in multiple games. Click on the link to see a list of `amiibos`_ .

Systems
-------

The Wii U GamePad is used for amiibos. The Nintendo 2DS and 3DS require a separate peripheral. The New 3DS has an NFC feature built-in and it functions just like the Wii U GamePad, and no peripheral is needed.
