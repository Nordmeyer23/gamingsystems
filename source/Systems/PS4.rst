The Personal Favorite
---------------------

	The Sony Play Station is a staple for most peopleâ€™s childhoods. The original
	Play Station was my first ever gaming system. That is assuming you do not  count 
	the little two button handheld games from McDonalds. Typically, those 
	are a track runner running in place with sticks coming at him where you have 
	to click one button to jump and it keeps track of your score. Ahhhh the simple 
	days. 

	The *PS4* launched in late 2013 alongside with its main rival Microsoft Xbox One.
	Personally I have used both systems and prefer using the PS4 for gaming. 
	What wins it for me is the exclusive games that Sony makes 
	and the amazing controller. I have bigger hands and need a 
	bigger wider controller Sony have provided me with the perfect controller.
	Plus, the stylish led back lighting on the controller depending on
	what is going on within a game and the motion sensors built within 
	the controller is fantastic. The PS4 features a fantastic AMD system.
	The PS4 uses both AMD equipment for its CPU and its GPU. 
	I really like this because I prefer using AMD systems myself. 
	Overall the **PS4** is a great system for every kind of user including children. 
	Sony has released multiple games for children and there are plenty 
	that private developers have created.
