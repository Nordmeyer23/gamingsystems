Xbox One

The Xbox One was released on November 22nd 2013 and is still kicking strong
with amazing sales. The Xbox one features a sleek design with some amazing
software and amazing games to back it up. I would like to say that having
a TV tuner built into the systems is a really nice feature, especially
since the idea of an all in one systems is mostly what people are wanting
to have now days. The idea of this one box does everything I want and
more is a pretty good deal. My favorite feature with this built in
TV tuner is the fact that the systems follows the idea that windows 8
and 10 use with the snap apps. You can be playing games on half of
your TV screen and the other half can be used to watch tonightâ€™s
basketball game, keeping you on track with all of our favorite
teams and games. 

Although the Xbox One is a really nice system I do find it really concerning
for how loud the fans in the system are and how much heat the system produces.
This is really scary because they system does it automatically to keep
it cool so my question is why is the systems heating up so quickly and
how long will the system last with that kind of heat?
