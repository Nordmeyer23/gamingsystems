The Truth
---------

	For all the people who browse the amazing world of Reddit, they all will see that the PC is never said alone. Instead when you say the letters *PC* you must also say PC Master Race. A PC is the master race of gaming systems because you can change it whenever you want with little to no restrictions. This is an amazing tool because when newer games are coming out and you want to be able to play at the highest graphics settings you are able to freely by just getting a graphics card installed. 


	The biggest difference between most **PCâ€™s** is who has installed AMD hardware and who has installed Nvidia/Intel hardware. Typically, if you use an AMD processor you will also get a AMD graphics card just to be able to match, and then if people get an intel processor they will usually get an Nvidia graphics card. This is the amazing part is picking out different options and almost any given time. The only catch to swapping out hardware left and right is the fact that the processors are different sizes and will not go into the same motherboards. Unfortunately, this is where you will need to make the decision on if you want to go the AMD path or the Intel path. Bother are fine selections and at the end it comes down to personal preference.
