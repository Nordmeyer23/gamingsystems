*WiiU*
======

The Wii is a system I had only for a few weeks. Although it was the
original Wii that I did play with I really did not enjoy it all that much.
I think it was a cool idea and concept and it was fun for a few games
a lot of games just seemed like there wasnâ€™t much of a point to
use the Wii features in order actually play the game. Which is
why I like the Play Station move system. Controllers for most
games and an occasional use of the move system. I ended up
selling my Wii for an Xbox.

The Wii U is the perfect system for a family, especially kids. The Wii
U features many games that are kid friendly and do not promote
killing and violence. Nintendo has a really cool concept
allowing the will to use hardware other than what is the stock
hardware that comes with the system this is really useful
because if you friend has a Nintendo 3DS he is able to use
that as his controller on the Wii U instead of requiring
him to buy his own `Wii U`_ equipment. Honestly the Wii U is
not a bad system I just personally do not really care for it.
Maybe I will in the future.
